# CLAUDE.md - WBD TouchScreen Dashboard

This file provides context and guidance for Claude when working with this codebase.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**WBD Executive Slate TouchScreen** - A touch-optimized dashboard for Warner Bros. Discovery executive slate planning, designed for 85-inch touchscreen displays and iPad testing.

### Core Purpose
This Monday.com app displays movie/TV titles organized by year, allowing executives to drag titles between years while viewing financial projections, production status, and other key metrics. Originally stuck on "missing column mappings" screen despite having 92 items loaded - fixed by bypassing the check.

### Key Features
- 🎯 **Drag-and-drop title management** between years with touch support
- 📊 **Real-time Monday.com integration** via OAuth (no API keys needed)
- 👔 **View presets**: Executive, Financial, Production, and Full views
- 🎨 **Customizable column visibility** for each card
- 🌙 **Theme modes**: Regular (light), Dark, Night (purple accents)
- 📱 **Touch-optimized interface** with 44px+ touch targets
- 📈 **Visual analytics**: Revenue, investment, ROI charts
- 💾 **Auto-sync**: Changes save back to Monday.com boards

## 📱 Current State (Last Updated: 2025-07-20 - v1.0 Release)

### 🚨 Critical Context
- **Initial Problem**: App was stuck on "missing column mappings" screen
- **Solution Applied**: Set `if (false)` at line 1648 in App.js to bypass column check
- **Result**: App now loads and displays all 92 items from Monday.com board
- **GitHub**: Repository at https://github.com/TCanDaMan/WB-Slate-Touchscreen-App

## 🏗️ Architecture

### File Structure
```
src/
├── App.js              # Main component with all dashboard logic
├── App.css             # All styles including touch optimizations
├── SimpleUI.js         # Lightweight UI components
└── index.js           # App entry point
```

### Key Components
- **Year Columns**: Flexbox containers with scrollable title lists
- **Title Cards**: Draggable items with touch event handlers
- **Customization Panel**: Slide-out panel for view configuration
- **Single-Line Header**: Compact header with all controls

### Data Flow
1. Monday.com SDK provides board data via OAuth
2. Column mapping handled automatically
3. Items organized by year for drag-drop
4. Changes sync back to Monday.com

## 🚀 Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development (http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# Build for production (simplified script without cross-env/craco)
npm run build

# Deploy to Monday.com (run after build completes)
mapps code:push

# Clean deploy script (if available)
./deploy-clean.bat

# Test on iPad (same network)
# Use your computer's IP: http://[your-ip]:3000

# Git operations
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```

### Build Notes
- Build may need to run outside WSL environment
- Uses react-scripts directly (no craco/cross-env)
- Wait for build completion before deploying

## 🎨 Current Layout Specifications

### Header (Single Line)
- Height: ~48px (was ~150px)
- Layout: Logo | Title | Tabs | Metrics | Filters | Actions
- Responsive: Wraps at 1400px and 1100px breakpoints

### Title Cards
- Padding: 8px 10px
- Margin: 4px 0
- Font sizes: Title 1.1rem, Details 0.7rem
- Data cells: Styled with backgrounds and borders

### Year Columns  
- Padding: 12px
- Header: Compact with smaller financials
- Titles list: Scrollable with custom scrollbar
- Min height: calc(100vh - 200px)

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Monday.com App Environment

- Touch-action CSS properties applied
- Native touch events implemented
- Drag feedback via opacity changes

### Performance
- Minimal re-renders during drag
- GPU-accelerated transforms
- Efficient year-based data structure
- No heavy UI libraries

### Monday.com Integration
- OAuth authentication (no API keys)
- Automatic column mapping
- Real-time sync
- Runs in iframe environment

## 🔍 Quick Reference

### Key Functions (App.js)
- `handleTitleMove(titleId, fromYear, toYear)`: Drag-drop logic with Monday.com sync
- `handleColumnToggle(column)`: Toggle column visibility
- `handlePresetChange(presetKey)`: Apply view preset
- `fetchBoardData()`: Load items from Monday.com board
- `updateMondayItem(itemId, columnId, value)`: Sync changes back
- `handleTouchStart/Move/End()`: Touch event handlers

### Key Data Structures
```javascript
// Column definitions
const AVAILABLE_COLUMNS = {
  title: { label: 'Title', type: 'text', default: true },
  year: { label: 'Year', type: 'text', default: true },
  genre: { label: 'Genre', type: 'text', default: true },
  status: { label: 'Status', type: 'status', default: true },
  budget: { label: 'Budget', type: 'money', default: false },
  // ... more columns
};

// View presets
const COLUMN_PRESETS = {
  executive: {
    label: 'Executive View',
    columns: ['title', 'year', 'status', 'projectedRevenue', 'roi']
  },
  // ... other presets
};
```

### Key Styles (App.css)
- `.title-card`: Card styling with overflow:visible for edit button
- `.edit-button-top`: Top-right positioned edit button
- `.drop-indicator`: Adds 60px margin when dragging over
- `.wbd-header-single-line`: Header layout
- `.year-header`: Sticky header with backdrop blur
- `.titles-list`: Independently scrollable container
- `.detail`: Data point cells

### State Management
- `items`: All titles from Monday.com
- `visibleColumns`: Currently shown columns
- `activePreset`: Current view preset
- `themeMode`: regular/dark/night

## 💡 Tips for Future Development

1. **Always test on actual touch devices** - Chrome simulation isn't enough
2. **Preserve vertical space** - Every pixel counts on landscape displays  
3. **Keep touch targets large** - 44px minimum, 60px preferred
4. **Test with real Monday.com data** - Sample data may hide issues
5. **Check all view presets** - Each shows different columns
6. **Build outside WSL if needed** - User reported WSL build issues
7. **Check column mapping bypass** - Ensure `if (false)` remains at line 1648
8. **Movie titles are key** - User emphasized titles as "biggest datapoint"

## 🔐 Authentication & Deployment

### Monday OAuth Setup
- No .env file needed - uses OAuth
- Authentication handled by Monday.com framework
- Permissions granted during app installation

### Deployment Process
1. Run `npm run build` (may need to run outside WSL)
2. Wait for build to complete fully
3. Run `mapps code:push` to deploy
4. Test in Monday.com board view
